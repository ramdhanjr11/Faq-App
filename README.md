### Questions
Create a project using Flutter with the following requirements:

- Create CRUD pages for listing posts, showing post detail, create post, and edit post
- Utilize the endpoints in Endpoint Testing Applicant IMP
- Use Flutter package for component
- Use package  flutter_form_builder for form validations
- Use package dio for data fetching
- Use state management concepts

Notes: We want to see how you solve the requirements above. You do not need to have a complex UI design as the Flutter has sensible defaults that you can leverage. We expect the project would take 4-5 hours for the functionality to be there.

Host the finished project with a proper README file in Git repository services such as GitHub and GitLab and share the link with us, then set the GitHub and GitLab to auto build the apk.
